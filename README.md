# Technical Challenge for Software Engineer

## Description
Develop a financial asset trading platform for individual investors. The platform should enable investors to trade stocks, options, futures, and other financial assets.

## Requirements
### Backend
- Language: Python or Rust
- Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL (We like PostgreSQL)
- If you are applying for a frontend-focused position, a fully hardcoded JSON is sufficient to serve as the 'backend'

### Frontend
- ReactJS, VueJS or QwikJS (We like Qwik)

### Features
- Donâ€™t worry about implementing a full login flow, you can hardcode it as well.
- The platform should allow investors to view information about financial assets, such as price, volume, and profitability.
- The platform should allow investors to place buy and sell orders for financial assets.
- The platform should allow investors to monitor the status of their orders.

### Example
An investor can place an order to buy 100 shares of company XYZ at a price of $100.00. If the order is executed, the investor will buy the shares for $10,000.00.

### Evaluation
For the evaluation, we are more interested in how you understand the requirements and how you would approach implementing them, rather than in having a fully functional system. What matters most is that you can explain in the technical interview the reasoning behind your decisions and highlight potential areas for improvement in your solution.

### Delivery Time:

The candidate will have 14 days to complete the challenge.
We know that you may have a lot on your plate right now, so if you think that this deadline is not achievable, let us know which deadline would fit in your schedule.

### Delivery
The candidate must submit the system code along with documentation explaining how the system works.
Bonus point for dockerised solutions.
